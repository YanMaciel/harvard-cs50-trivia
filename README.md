# Academic Honesty
If you are taking Harvard's CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science course you **must follow the course's [Academic Honesty philosophy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/)**.

It is not reasonable to access a solution to some assessement prior to (re-)submitting your own.

The essence of all work that you submit to the CS50 course **must be your own**. 

# CS50's Trivia

# Created with 
This webpage uses HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

#Access
You can access the webpage at: https://yanmaciel.github.io/harvard-cs50-trivia/
  
# What I learned
Despite being a simple webpage, in this exercise I could see how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to design interactive webpages and web applications.
